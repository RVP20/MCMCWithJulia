# MCMCWithJulia

## Overview
This project mainly focuses on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provides a class of algorithms for systematic random sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. MCMC techniques often solve integration and optimization problems in large dimensional spaces. These two types of problems play a fundamental role in machine learning. Just going over the theory is boring. This project involved a substantial computational aspect, and we were asked to implement various algorithms, preferably in Julia. 

The list of topics that were covered is as follows:
1. Sampling Methods and general Monte Carlo methods
2. Rejection Sampling and Importance Sampling
3. Markov Chain and Measure Theory basics
4. Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
5. Accelerating MCMC Algorithms
6. MCMC Algorithms for Intractable Posteriors

## Assignment 1:
1. Implement a Discrete Inverse Transform sampler for Poisson distribution.
2. Implement a Discrete Accept Reject Sampler to simulate draws from Binomial(n, p) using a Poisson proposal.
